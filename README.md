# üí´ About Me:
Currently, I am the technical lead of a 7-member development team. We work in 2-week sprints following agile methodologies. In addition to development, my responsibilities include assisting and mentoring team members.<br><br>I develop custom PHP applications, ranging from version 5.6 to 8.2. I have experience with frameworks such as Laravel, and occasionally Lumen for smaller projects. In the majority of cases, we use the Postgresql database, but I have also worked with MySQL and Oracle database systems. We often containerize and run the applications using Docker.<br><br>I also work with frontend development, representing a strong intermediate level. I have already developed Vue.js and Angular applications.<br><br>I always develop my applications following the principles of Clean Code, which is also emphasized in my team. We also pay attention to writing tests.<br><br>I use Jira for ticketing system, Confluence for documentation, Git for version control, and both Bitbucket and Github as code repositories.<br><br>In my free time, I started working with Flutter development and complemented it with Node.js (Nest.js) backend development. Currently, I'm also participating in an Angular frontend (based on TypeScript) training, expanding my knowledge in this stack. I have a keen interest in operational (DevOps) processes as well. I run the applications I create on my own server. For Docker management, I use Portainer, for monitoring, I use Grafana, and for log analysis, I use Kibana. I deploy my applications using Jenkins.
